# UX Writing

Write clear, concise, user-centered interface copy (UX text/microcopy) for digital products and experiences. This skill provides frameworks, patterns, and best practices for creating text that helps users accomplish their goals.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Writing interface copy (buttons, labels, titles, messages, forms)
- Editing existing UX text for clarity and effectiveness
- Creating error messages, notifications, or success messages
- Designing conversational flows or onboarding experiences
- Establishing voice and tone for a product
- Auditing product content for consistency and usability

## Core UX Writing Principles

### The Four Quality Standards

Every piece of UX text should be:

1. **Purposeful** — Helps users or the business achieve goals
2. **Concise** — Uses the fewest words possible without losing meaning
3. **Conversational** — Sounds natural and human, not robotic
4. **Clear** — Unambiguous, accurate, and easy to understand

### Key Best Practices

**Conciseness**
- Use 40-60 characters per line maximum
- Every word must have a job
- Break dense text into scannable chunks
- Front-load important information

**Clarity**
- Use plain language (7th grade reading level for general, 10th for professional)
- Avoid jargon, idioms, and technical terms
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Choose meaningful, specific verbs

**Conversational Tone**
- Write how you speak
- Use active voice 85% of the time
- Include prepositions and articles
- Avoid robotic phrasing

**User-Centered**
- Focus on user benefits, not features
- Anticipate and answer user questions
- Use second-person ("you") language
- Match user's language and mental models

## UX Text Patterns

Apply these common patterns for interface elements.

### Titles
- **Purpose**: Orient users to where they are
- **Format**: Noun phrases, sentence case
- **Types**: Brand titles, content titles, category titles, task titles
- **Examples**: "Account settings", "Your library", "Create new post"

### Buttons and Links
- **Purpose**: Enable users to take action
- **Format**: Active imperative verbs, sentence case
- **Pattern**: `[Verb] [object]` 
- **Examples**: "Save changes", "Delete account", "View details"
- **Avoid**: Generic labels like "OK", "Submit", "Click here"

### Error Messages
- **Purpose**: Explain problem and provide solution
- **Format**: Empathetic, clear, actionable
- **Types**:
  - **Inline**: Brief, in-context correction guidance ("Email must include @")
  - **Detour**: Problem explanation + recovery instructions
  - **Blocking**: Clear explanation + specific next steps
- **Avoid**: Technical codes, blame language ("invalid", "illegal"), robotic tone

### Success Messages
- **Purpose**: Confirm action completion
- **Format**: Past tense, specific, encouraging
- **Pattern**: `[Action] [result/benefit]`
- **Examples**: "Changes saved", "Email sent", "Profile updated"

### Empty States
- **Purpose**: Guide users when content is absent
- **Types**: First-use, user-cleared, error/no results
- **Format**: Explanation + CTA to populate
- **Example**: "No messages yet. Start a conversation to connect with your team."

### Form Fields
- **Labels**: Clear noun phrases describing input ("Email address", "Phone number")
- **Instructions**: Verb-first, explain why information is needed
- **Placeholder**: Use sparingly, only for standard inputs like "name@example.com"
- **Helper text**: Static, on-demand, or automatic based on importance

### Notifications
- **Purpose**: Deliver timely, valuable information
- **Types**: Action-required (intrusive), Passive (less intrusive)
- **Format**: Verb-first title + contextual description
- **Example**: "Update required. Install the latest version to continue."

## Voice and Tone

### Voice (Consistent Brand Personality)
Voice is the consistent personality of the product. Establish voice using:
- **Concepts**: 3-5 key brand principles/values
- **Voice characteristics**: Descriptive adjectives for each concept
- **Do/Don't examples**: Concrete examples showing voice in action

See references/voice-chart-template.md for creating a voice chart.

### Tone (Adaptive to Context)
Tone adapts based on:
- **Purpose**: Why user is seeing this text
- **Context**: What user is trying to do
- **Emotional state**: How user likely feels (frustrated, excited, confused)

**Map content types to appropriate tones:**
- Error messages: Empathetic, reassuring, solution-focused
- Success messages: Positive, celebratory (appropriately)
- Instructions: Clear, direct, helpful
- Onboarding: Inviting, encouraging, concise

## Editing Process

Edit UX text in four phases:

### Phase 1: Purposeful
- Does text help user achieve their goal?
- Does text serve business objectives?
- Is value to user clear?
- Are concerns anticipated and addressed?

### Phase 2: Concise
- Remove unnecessary words
- Combine redundant information
- Ensure every word earns its space
- Front-load important concepts

### Phase 3: Conversational
- Read aloud—would you say this?
- Use active voice (unless passive is clearer)
- Include natural connecting words
- Avoid corporate jargon

### Phase 4: Clear
- Use specific, accurate verbs
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Test readability (Hemingway Editor, Flesch-Kincaid)
- Ensure unambiguous meaning

## Workflow

1. **Understand context**
   - User goals and needs
   - Business objectives
   - Technical constraints
   - Emotional state of user

2. **Draft content**
   - Start with conversation (what would you say?)
   - Apply appropriate pattern
   - Consider voice and tone
   - Front-load important information

3. **Edit iteratively**
   - Phase 1: Purposeful
   - Phase 2: Concise
   - Phase 3: Conversational
   - Phase 4: Clear

4. **Test and measure**
   - Review with team
   - Test with users when possible
   - Measure task completion, comprehension
   - Iterate based on feedback

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using passive voice excessively
- Generic button labels ("Submit", "OK")
- Blaming users in error messages
- Overly clever humor in serious contexts
- Inconsistent terminology
- Hidden instructions or explanations
- System-oriented language vs. user language
- Too many words (not concise enough)
- Robotic, corporate tone

## Quick Reference

**Sentence case**: "Save your changes" (not "Save Your Changes")  
**Active imperative for buttons**: "Delete account" (not "Account deletion")  
**User-focused**: "Save time with shortcuts" (not "We offer shortcuts")  
**Specific verbs**: "Delete" (not "Remove" when permanently deleting)  
**Front-loaded**: "Password must be 8 characters" (not "Must be 8 characters for your password")

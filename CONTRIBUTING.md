## Contribution Guidelines

### Content Standards

All contributions should follow these principles:

1. **Evidence-based**: Based on established UX writing best practices or user research
2. **Actionable**: Provides clear, practical guidance
3. **Concise**: Respects the reader's time
4. **Well-structured**: Easy to scan and reference
5. **Example-rich**: Shows, doesn't just tell

### Style Guidelines

- Use sentence case for headings
- Use em dashes (—) not hyphens (-) for breaks
- Keep examples realistic and specific
- Include both "do" and "don't" examples where helpful
- Score examples against the four quality standards when relevant
